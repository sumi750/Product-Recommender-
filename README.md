# 📘 E-commerce Product Recommender — Backend API
## This backend provides a Product Recommendation API that analyzes user interactions (views, clicks, purchases) and generates AI-powered explanations using OpenAI.
🎯 Objective
- Combine recommendation logic with LLM-powered explanations for users.

📌 Referencing the assignment specification
- Input: Product catalog + user behavior
- Output: Recommended products + LLM-generated explanation (“Why this product?”)
- Optional frontend dashboard showing recommendations


🧠Technical Expectations
- Backend API for recommendations
- Database for products & user interaction
- LLM for explanation text


LLM Usage Guidance:
- Example prompt: “Explain why product X is recommended to this user based on their behavior.”

🚀 Features
✔ Product Recommendation API
- Suggests products based on user browsing patterns
- Category & tag similarity
- Popularity scoring

✔ LLM-powered Explanations
- Each recommended product includes a short explanation generated by OpenAI GPT using the file openaiClient.js.



✔ MongoDB Database

Stores:
- Products
- Users
- User interactions (views, clicks, purchases)

✔ Seed Script
- Quickly populate:
- Sample products
- A sample user
- Interaction data


🔧 Setup Instructions

 1️⃣ Install dependencies
 
 cd Backend
 
 npm install

 2️⃣ Configure environment variables
 
  PORT=4000
  
  MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
  
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

  ⚠️ Do NOT upload .env to GitHub.

  3️⃣ Seed the database

  npm run dev

  This inserts:
  - Sample products
  - A test user
  - Interactions

You will receive a User ID in the terminal output.
Use this ID to test the recommendation API.

4️⃣ Start the backend server

npm run dev

📡 API Endpoints

}



🧠 How Recommendations Work

Logic used (services/recommender.js):

- Category matching
- Tag similarity (Jaccard similarity score)
- Popularity boost
- Sorted by score
- Top 5–6 items returned

Explanation generation is done through:
services/openaiClient.js → OpenAI GPT model.


🧪 Testing the API

Test in Postman:
- Method: GET
- URL: http://localhost:4000/api/recommend/<userId>

🛡️ Security Notes

Never expose your .env file

Use MongoDB user credentials, not admin user

Restrict OpenAI key usage to server-side only
